Server source files:

Server.java
    Manages network connections with CPET clients
    Invokes dispatcher to handle protocol requests

dispatch.py
    Receives all protocol requests
    Invokes receptacles for protocol requests that need them
    Carries out other protocol requests directly, e.g., querying database

receptacles/*
    Receptacles, with executable names same as the receptacle name, 
        e.g, Scheme (a python script)

receptacles/lib.py
    Code shared by python receptacles

Makefile
    For generating executables/object files, e.g., make Server.class
    Default target ordinarily makes all programs necessary for CPET server

-------------- testing software ------------------------

tests.m4
    Source for protocol tests, which call dispatcher directly
    To make and run tests:    
        make tests.sh
	make tests
    make tests compares output against tests.out. To regenerate tests.out:
        make out

TestClient.java
    For testing Server.java
    Repeatedly reads a raw protocol expression, evaluates it, and
        prints the results

TestClient2.java
    For testing Server.java
    Repeatedly reads a raw protocol expression, evaluates it, and
        prints the results, reusing same socket connection (persistent)

======================================================================
TO DO:

Merge TestClient and TestClient2 into a single program, with flags 
  -persistent, -transient to govern choice.


NOTES:

Latest attempts to get SSL server to talk to Javascript/Mozilla are stored in 
Server.java 1.16.1.1, TestClient2.java 1.2.1.1, startServer 1.2.1.1
which use the same cipher suites as Javascript/Mozilla and produce the same 
bug...
